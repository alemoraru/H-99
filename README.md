# H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

This repository contains my solutions to the problems that can be found [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).<br>
For most of the exercises I tried multiple solutions, either via recursion, high-order functions, pattern matching where possible.

**Note**: While I did check my solutions locally, I did not make use of property based testing such as QuickCheck so it is entirely possible that I made some mistakes somewhere. In case you find such errors, please create issue and do let me know of them, thanks!
