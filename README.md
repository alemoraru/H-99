# H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

This repository contains my solutions to the problems that can be found [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).<br>
For most of the exercises I tried multiple solutions, either via list comprehensions, recursion, high-order functions or pattern matching where possible.

### **The problems**

* Questions 1 to 10: [Lists](Q01-10\Lists.md)
* Questions 11 to 20: [Lists, continued](Q11-20\Lists-continued.md)
* Questions 21 to 28: [Lists again]()
* Questions 31 to 41: [Arithmetic]()
* Questions 46 to 50: [Logic and codes]()
* Questions 54A to 60: [Binary trees]()
* Questions 61 to 69: [Binary trees, continued]()
* Questions 70B to 73: [Multiway trees]()
* Questions 80 to 89: [Graphs]()
* Questions 90 to 94: [Miscellaneous problems]()
* Questions 95 to 99: [Miscellaneous problems, continued]()


**Note**: While I did check my solutions locally, I did not make use of property based testing such as QuickCheck so it is entirely possible that I made some mistakes somewhere. In case you find such errors, please create an issue and do let me know of them, thanks!
